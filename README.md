# Hero_Ninja_Game
Simple game using java object oriented programming concepts.

In HERO NINJA GAME there are two types of characters called Ninjas and Devils. All of them have their own name and a health indicator. If the health indicator of a character becomes zero he will die. The ninja can attack Devil and Devil can attack Ninja. Ninja has an Armor with which he can reduce the damage when Devil attacks, but Devils can steal that armor from the Ninja. If a Devil has stolen the armor of a ninja, that particular Ninja can gain it again. According to that, Ninja will lose 2 from his health indicator if he hasnâ€™t the armor when a Devil attacks him. If he has the armor he lost only 1 from his health indicator. There are two types of Ninjas. They are Super Ninjas and Normal Ninjas. Only Super Ninjas can increase their health indicator by 1 at a time till it becomes full. If a Super Ninja attacks a Devil, Devil will be lost 2 from his health indicator. But if that attack is done by a Normal Ninja, Devil will be lost only 1 from his health indicator.
